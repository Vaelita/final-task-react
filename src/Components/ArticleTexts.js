                    <p className="justify-text">The first line of stress defense is to investigate how you spend your time. If you feel stressed, 
                        chances are your feelings are being triggered, at least in part, by your immediate environment. If you are inundated 
                        by distractions and noise, move and reestablish your workspace. We recommend creating a distraction-free and tranquil 
                        environment and, if possible, to work in a naturally well-lit room. Also, donâ€™t forget how your space smells! Studies 
                        suggest that aromatherapy using essential oils can help with anxiety and depression.</p>
                    <h5 className="card-title">Remember to breathe</h5>
                    <p className="justify-text">Breathing techniques are a quick and highly effective way to regulate our nervous system. Try to 
                        focus on breathing in for five counts and breathing out for five counts, and repeat several times. Because, remember, 
                         <u>everything will be okay</u>.</p>
                    <h5 className="card-title">Alone time is important</h5>
                    <p className="justify-text">Meditation is a universal favorite for relaxing when you work from home. It lowers stress levels, 
                        and brings calmness to your mind. Regular meditation practice helps people be able to shift their focus to the important 
                        things. It also helps to be more aware and accepting of own thoughts and feelings without judgment.</p>
